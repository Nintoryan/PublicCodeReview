## Why?
A lot of people have been asking me lately to show examples of my code. However, almost everything I do is subject to NDA, so I decided to make this repository, in which I posted example code for a project I recently worked on. Almost all of the game's assets have been removed and only the code remains, which has also been slightly modified.

## What is that
This Unity game was intended to be integrated as a web view. Therefore, it has code for communicating with the Javaskipt API on the browser side, as well as code for working with the back-end application.

## Architecture
I also was an architecture of this game. Here is a bit simplified schema of the architecture of the whole app.

So in this public repository represented only internal Unity logic of this app.

## What's now?
Now I can safely show off my code.
